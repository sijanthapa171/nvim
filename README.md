**This is my cool neovim configuration written in 100% lua ðŸ‘Œ**

**To install on windows, open command promp and then run the command below**
```console
rmdir /S /Q %homepath%\appdata\local\nvim &&
git clone https://github.com/sijanthapa171/nvim.git %homepath%\appdata\local\nvim
```
**Change the output path as needed. It will most likely be different on macos and linux.**
**also if you are using a terminal with neovim such as powershell, command prompt or any other terminal emulator, then download a nerd font.**

**A nerd font is required to see all the symbols that neovim uses.**
**the nerd font that I recommend is JetBrainsMono nerd font https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/**

**All Keymaps can be found in lua\core\keymaps.lua**

**Now you should be set up, have fun programming :)**
